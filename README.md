# Model Checking of Tower Defence Game
This repository contains the project of the course [088882 - FORMAL METHODS FOR CONCURRENT AND REAL-TIME SYSTEMS (UIC 545)[2024-25]](https://onlineservices.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ManifestoPublic.do?EVN_DETTAGLIO_RIGA_MANIFESTO=evento&aa=2024&k_cf=225&k_corso_la=481&k_indir=T2A&codDescr=088882&lang=IT&semestre=2&idGruppo=4934&idRiga=308166), a Computer Science and Engineering Master's Degree course at Politecnico di Milano.

The purpose of this project was to show how we can create a formal representation of a simple problem, how to exploit it to formally verify its properties and how we can extract information on the problem using formal results.

The problem in question is a Tower Defense Game, a strategy game in which the player aims to protect valuable assets from an enemy invasion by strategically setting up defences. 
The modeling tool used is [UPPAAL](https://uppaal.org/)
